## 🌟 Overview

**CurrencyCraft** is a minimal, fast, and responsive currency converter application built with the modern web stack. It serves as an excellent starting point for developers looking to showcase their skills in **Next.js**, **React Hooks**, and **external API consumption**.

The project is intentionally kept simple, focusing on core functionality and clean code structure, making it an ideal portfolio piece for demonstrating fundamental frontend development practices.

## ✨ Features

*   **Real-time Conversion:** Fetches the latest exchange rates from a reliable, free API.
*   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and mobile-friendly interface.
*   **Clean Architecture:** Uses a custom React Hook (`useExchangeRates` ) to separate data fetching logic from the UI components.
*   **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and improves code maintainability.
*   **No API Key Required:** Utilizes the public and free [Frankfurter API](https://www.frankfurter.app/ ) for exchange rate data.
